'xcookybooky' is a package for entering recipes
and layout them in a nice way. This package is
based on the 'cookybooky' package by Jürgen Gilg.
Unfortunately it uses some special packages and
fonts. Another handycap is missing possibility to
create a PDF directly. This limitations are reversed.

As a result of the changes not all options known
from 'cookybooky' are implemented in this package.
But nevertheless it provides some new options, e.g.
an improved color and fontsize management and more
recipe fields.


Usage
----------------------------------
The recipes are inserted in a environment. There is
the possibility to enter ingredients, preparation (steps),
(two) pictures and a hint. Also there is an option
to insert the recipetime, bakingtime, portions, calory
content and source of the recipe (internet, friends,
neighbours etc.).


Package contents
----------------------------------
The current distribution is zipped up as
    'xcookybooky.zip'
and includes the following files
    'xcookybooky.ins',
    'xcookybooky.dtx',
	'xcookybooky.pdf',
    'README'.
Also there is a folder including an example, which
helps you (hopefully) to understand the usage of this
package.
